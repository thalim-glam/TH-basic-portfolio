# TH-basic-portfolio

## Description

This is the "Advanced CSS" homework for the coding boodcamp. 
- My motivation was to learn HTML and CSS better. And doing this project helped me a lot!
- I always wanted to have my own portfolio. As a Computer Science teacher, I always helped my students to build their portfolio but never tried my own in recent years.
- This project helped me to learn more about how to design a website better. I have learnt tons of things regarding "Web designing".
- Apart from basic HTML and CSS, I learnet how to inspect a website, how inspect can help in debugging, how web designs can vary a lot by just changing margin, padding, border change etc. Over all, working on thi sproject was very helpful in my learning.
